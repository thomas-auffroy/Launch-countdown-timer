## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Js vanilla

### What I learned

Observer in js; It helps me to animate when the counter was decreasing.
I use multiple pseudo-elements (::before, ::after) to build the cards, I guess that has imporved a bit my skills in css.

### Continued development

Keep going on js.
